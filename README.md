# Battleships

A modern, polished implementation of the classic naval combat game built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. Play directly in your browser against a smart computer opponent.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Place your fleet on a 10x10 grid and battle the computer
- **Smart AI Opponent**: Once the AI hits a ship, it will hunt adjacent cells to sink it before firing randomly again
- **Operations Room UI**: Tactical green-on-dark naval theme with animated radar sweep on enemy waters
- **Visual Ship Icons**: Each ship is represented by a block icon sized to its length in the status panel and legend
- **Sunk Ship Wreckage**: Sunk ships display skulls and dark red radar glow to mark destroyed vessels
- **Win Banner**: Non-blocking victory/defeat banner keeps the final board state visible
- **On-Screen Instructions**: A prompt appears when the firing phase begins
- **Responsive Single-Screen Layout**: Designed to fit without scrolling on typical screens

## How to Play

1. **Ship Placement**: Click on the "Friendly Waters" grid to place your 5 ships:
   - Carrier (5), Battleship (4), Cruiser (3), Submarine (3), Destroyer (2)
2. **Orientation**: Use the **HORIZ / VERT** button to toggle placement direction
3. **Start Game**: Once your fleet is deployed, the enemy ships are placed automatically
4. **Attack**: When you see the prompt "🎯 Click any square to fire a missile", click a square in the "Enemy Waters" grid
5. **Win Condition**: Sink every enemy ship before the computer sinks yours!

|---------|-------------|
| Grid click (placement) | Place the currently selected ship |

## Game Logic

- **Grid**: 10x10 array representing each board
- **Cell States**: Empty, Ship, Hit, Miss, Sunk
- **Game Phases**: Placement, Playing, Game Over
- **Ships**: Array of ship objects with name and size, tracked for placement and sinking
- **AI**: Maintains a queue of hunt targets after each successful hit to sink ships efficiently

## Deployment

The project is configured for static hosting on **GitHub Pages** via `gh-pages`.
